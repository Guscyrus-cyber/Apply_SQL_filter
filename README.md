# Apply_SQL_filter
SQL queries is to interact with and manage data stored in relational databases, enabling efficient retrieval, manipulation, and organization of information. SQL queries allow us to perform operations such as selecting specific data based on conditions, updating records, deleting unnecessary entries, and inserting new data. By applying filters to these queries, we can refine the results to meet specific criteria, ensuring that only relevant and meaningful data is accessed. This enhances decision-making, improves application performance, and maintains data integrity. Whether for generating reports, analyzing trends, or supporting real-time applications, SQL queries provide a powerful and flexible way to manage and utilize data effectively.
In this lab, I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. I used two different tables, log_in_attempts and employees. I used the AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task. I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.
